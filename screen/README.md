To show the performance of DeepDonor, a large-scale polymer donor materials screening process was built as shown in Figure. 



## Molecular generation



![generation](J:\DeepDonor\screen\generation.jpg)

A fragments-based molecule design framework was built by using the breaking of retrosynthetically interesting chemical substructures (BRICS) algorithm and variational autoencoder (VAE) to obtain a database with specific potential molecular properties. The detailed process is shown in Figure 2. The fragments were generated from existing molecules, as similar structures often have similar properties. In this study, the framework was used to generate polymer monomer molecules. Specifically, the BRICS algorithm  was used to decomposed existing molecules into constituent fragments, these substructures were divided into terminals (T), cores (C) and spacers (S) according to molecular weights and numbers of groups to be attached. Then, new molecules were generated by recomposing the fragments in the order of T-S-C-S-T and S-C-S-T by BRICS algorithm. Besides, to generate more diverse structures and explore more efficient fragments, the newly generated dataset by BRICS was used as the input of the VAE. Specifically, all the SMILES were converted into SELFIES, which is a 100% robust molecular representation. Then strings of alphabet were encoded into vectors using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). An encoder along with a decoder RNN was used to perform sequence-to-sequence learning. 500 thousand molecules were used to train the VAE and then the trained model was used to generated new molecules. The encoder was built by three fully connected layers. The dimension of the layers is 100. The rectified linear unit (ReLU) was used as the activation function. The decoder was built by four fully connected hidden layers with the dimension of 50 and activation function of ReLU. A probability distribution for all possible symbols at each position was defined by the final layer of the decoder in the SELFIES string with the activation function of sigmoid. Finally, the generated SELFIES were converted into SMILES, and the Gen database was formed by the SMILES generated by BRICS and VAE. The database containing about 3.9 million compounds was generated from existing donor materials.

## Basic properties

A donor screening process was built to find easy-to-synthesize, stable, high-performance donor candidate materials. The Gen database was firstly screened by some basic properties by using RDKit. Properties such as molecular weight, log *P*, the number of H-bond acceptors and donors, number of aromatic rings and heterocycles, number of rotatable bonds, number of radical electrons were chosen as the indicators, which are related to the solubility, synthesis difficulty, performance of the OSC materials. The cutoff values for each indicator are set based on the values that exceed 50% of the experimental high-performance molecular properties. 



## SAscore & SCScore

SAscore  and SCScore was used to synthetic accessibility and complexity. SAscore is a useful way to measure synthetic accessibility by analyzing the fragment frequency of occurrence in PubChem and the presence of non-standard structural features that are unfavorable to synthesis. SCScore was trained on 22 million reactantâˆ’product pairs in the Reaxys database, the compounds that require more synthetic steps are considered more difficult to synthesize. Molecules with SAscore < 3.5 and SCScore < 4.0 were obtained in this way. 



## **DeepChemStable**

The compound stability was evaluated by DeepChemStable. The DeepChemStable was trained on COMDECOM, which is a compound library with empirical results of chemical stability prediction. Next, as shown in Figure 1, the DeepDonor was used to predict the PCE of the left molecules. Finally, these candidates with high PCE were selected and optimized by the experts, and further experimental validation was performed for promising molecules.
